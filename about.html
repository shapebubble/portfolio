        <h2>A Little Story About Me</h2>
        <p>Well as you know my name is Adam, I’m English and founded in the year 1983 but aside from that who am I?</p>
        <p>I am a designer and finished transport design in 2008 at Huddersfield Uni. My first job was at LEGO as a
            design with a vehicle specialism. I worked there until 2011 after which I left to start my own company
            initially in sculpture. But that was a bit rubbish so I diversified the business and used my contacts to
            identify what my clients actually wanted which turned out to be large planters.
            So I had quiet the product change there from cars to flower pots but they did well and I sold my work all
            over the world, won awards for my designs and had the featured in numerous media outlets. They even stand in
            the prestigious locations like Disneyland California and Platos café on the palm in Dubai. I nearly go them
            installed in Bergen town centre for the Norwegian royal families state visit but the lead time for
            production didn’t fit with the councils time scale which was a bummer.
            Sadly the main market for me was the UK and I had set up production in Portugal so when Brexit came in it
            would have been devastating. Corona meant that production quality fell off the cliff and I needed to invest
            £30,000+ in the business to maintain and expand it. So with all that combined it just didn’t make sense to
            wait for Brexit to cripple the business so I took the difficult decision to closed it down and start a new
            career.
            Having all that behind me I now have a raft of skills that I am eager to use and cross with my new UI/UX
            specific skills
            Having all that behind me I feel I have something extra to offer clients as I am not just a designer or
            project manager but an ex business owner that has a holistic idea of how things work and who needs what.
